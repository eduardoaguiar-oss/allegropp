# Allegro++

**Allegro++** is a modern C++ wrapper for the [Allegro](https://liballeg.org/) game library, designed to simplify game development by providing an object-oriented interface to Allegro's powerful features. This project aims to make Allegro more accessible and easier to use for C++ developers while maintaining the flexibility and performance of the original library.

---

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Allegro++ wraps Allegro's C API into intuitive C++ classes, making it easier to manage resources and structure your game code.
- **Cross-Platform**: Like Allegro, Allegro++ works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with existing Allegro projects or as a standalone library.
- **Modern C++**: Utilizes modern C++ features like RAII, smart pointers, and STL containers for safer and cleaner code.
- **Extensible**: Easily extend Allegro++ to add custom functionality or integrate with other libraries.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Allegro Library**: Allegro++ requires Allegro 5.x to be installed on your system. Download it from the [official website](https://liballeg.org/).
- **C++ Compiler**: A C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- **CMake**: For building the project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eduardoaguiar-oss/allegropp.git
   cd allegropp
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

3. Install the library (optional):

   ```bash
   sudo cmake --install .
   ```

## Usage

`Allegro++` is a C++ wrapper for the Allegro Game Library, designed to simplify game development by providing a modern, object-oriented interface. The "examples" directory contains simple demonstration programs designed to illustrate how to use Allegro++.

### HebrewCard: A Practical Example
To help you get started with `Allegro++`, the [hebrewcard](https://github.com/eduardoaguiar-oss/hebrewcard) project serves as a functional example of how to use the library in a real-world application. Hebrewcard is an interactive flashcard program designed to help users learn and memorize Hebrew letters. It demonstrates key features of `Allegro++`, including:

- **Window and Rendering Management**: Creating and managing a window, rendering text, and handling display updates.
- **Event Handling**: Processing user input, such as keyboard events, to navigate between flashcards.
- **Resource Management**: Loading and using fonts and other assets.

By exploring the `hebrewcard` source code, you can see how `Allegro++` is used to build a fully functional application. Hereâ€™s how you can get started:

1. **Clone the `hebrewcard` repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eduardoaguiar-oss/hebrewcard.git
   cd hebrewcard
   ```

2. **Build and run `hebrewcard`**:
   Follow the instructions in the `hebrewcard` repository to build and run the project. This will give you hands-on experience with `Allegro++` in action.

3. **Study the code**:
   Review the `hebrewcard` source code to understand how `Allegro++` is integrated into the project. Pay special attention to:
   - How the `Allegro++` library is initialized and configured.
   - How rendering and event handling are implemented.
   - How resources like fonts are managed.
